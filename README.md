# Introduction to cloud computing 

* The impact of cloud computing on businesses across industries cannot be overstated.
* It has revolutionized the way organizations operate, offering essential features like on-demand access to computing power and storage, virtually unlimited scalability, and flexible pricing models.
* As a result, startups have been able to disrupt established industry players, while established businesses have leveraged the cloud to enhance their capabilities and rapidly transform their processes.
* Initially, the adoption of cloud technologies focused primarily on cost reduction and shifting technology expenditures from capital to operational expenses.
* Cloud vendors prioritized lowering costs for standard computing and storage resources.
* While cost reduction remains a significant factor in cloud adoption, companies now recognize the potential of cloud services to drive business transformation.
* As a result, most organizations have embraced a pragmatic hybrid cloud strategy, utilizing a combination of public and private cloud services based on their specific business needs.
* They retain critical applications within their data centers while leveraging innovative SoThe cloud market has evolved to cater to diverse customer requirements.
* Cloud providers now specialize in specific areas to deliver unique value to customers.ftware as a Service (SaaS) applications and cloud infrastructure services.
* The cloud market has evolved to cater to diverse customer requirements. Cloud providers now specialize in specific areas to deliver unique value to customers.
* Some focus on offering machine learning services, while others specialize in governance cloud services.
* Additionally, a range of cloud storage services is available from various vendors.

# Five characteristics defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
# ON-Demand Self-Service

* Consumers can provision resources as needed and automatically. Cloud services consumers can provision services on an as-needed basis, without the need to work with the CSP (Cloud service provider) directly.
* These resources might include additional compute power, additional storage, new websites, or even database services.
* The consumer can expand (or reduce) these services without the need for human assistance from the CSP.

# Broad Network Access

* Services are available across the network from commonly available clients.
* Client devices and traditional server deployments are able to access cloud-based resources across the network.
* The network might include the local on-premises network or the Internet, or both. Cloud resources have the potential to be globally accessible.

# Resource Pooling

* The cloud service provider (CSP) pools resources in a multitenant model and adjusts resource allocation on an on-demand basis, and the specific distribution of hardware resources is abstracted from the consumer.
* CSPs pool network, storage, and compute capabilities and then dynamically and automatically allocate those resources to consumers on an on-demand basis.
* The consumers do not know (or care) where the resources might physically be located.
* The next time those services are used by the consumer, the resource locations might have changed.
* The CSP manages the resources and maximizes their use.

# Rapid Elasticity

* Resources are provisioned and released to adjust for changes in demand and consumption.
* This process may be automatic or manual.
* Server resources in a traditional model are purchased as a capital expenditure, and whether or not those resources are efficiently utilized, their cost and capabilities are fixed.
* In some business models, resource needs change throughout the year.
* For example, retail demand is significantly higher during some parts of the year than others.
* With cloud-based computing, resources are dynamically allocated, making for far more efficient utilization of those resources.
* Servers that might have been underutilized for most of the year no longer need to be purchased and maintained.

# Measured Service

* Metering of resources is monitored, controlled, and billable. CSPs meter the utilization of their resources.
* This metering permits more efficient and dynamic resource allocation.
* It also permits the CSPs to bill consumers accurately for exactly the quantity of resources consumed.

# Understaing Cloud Concepts 

# Cloud computing

* Is a method of providing shared computing resources, including applications, computing, storage, networking, development, and deployment platforms as well as business processes.
* Cloud computing makes computing resources easier to use by providing standardization and automation.

# Standardization

* Is the implementation of services using a consistent approach supported by a set of consistent interfaces.
* Likewise, the cloud generally requires that processes be implemented through the use of automation.

# Automation

* Is a process that’s triggered based on business rules, resource availability, and security demands.
*  Automation is required to support a self-service provisioning model. To promote efficiency, automation can ensure that after a provisioned service is no longer needed, it is returned to the resource pool.
* This type of rules-based automation can help with capacity planning and overall workload management. 

# Cloud Components and Clients

1. CSP data center - Hosts cloud services
2. Client - Means of access to cloud services for consumer.
3. Network - Path between cloud services and client devices

* Leading cloud service providers (CSPs), like Microsoft and Amazon, operate a vast network of data centers worldwide.
* These data centers are designed with redundancy, ensuring reliable power supply, internet connectivity, and physical security.
*  It is within these data centers that cloud services are hosted, providing a range of functionalities.
*  Cloud services cater to a wide range of consumers, encompassing individuals and businesses alike, on various platforms.
* These services can include storage, email, e-commerce, office suites, and development environments, among others.
* Users can access these services from a multitude of devices, such as phones, tablets, traditional computers, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and servers.
* The devices connecting to the cloud can be anything equipped with a network connection.
* The primary operating systems used on these client devices include Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.

* The cloud service infrastructure can be managed internally by a single organization for its own use or managed by a CSP that provides services to many organizations.
* These two models can be combined into a hybrid solution. 



* Public cloud:  A CSP owns the cloud deployment and allocates its resources to external, unaffiliated customers. Those customers share the public cloud’s resources without knowing precisely where their data is in relation to that of any other organization.
*  Private cloud:  Services are provided to only a single organization.
* Hybrid cloud:  There is a combination of two or more private, public, or community deployments.

# The Public Cloud

* The public cloud is a set of hardware, networking, storage, services, applications, and interfaces owned and operated by a third party for use by other companies or individuals.
* CSPs offer public cloud services to virtually any customer. Customers use a subscription model to pay for access.
* These commercial providers or CSPs create a highly scalable data center that hides the details of the underlying infrastructure from the consumer, no customer has any real understanding of precisely where their resources or data may be at a given moment.
* In the background, the CSP dynamically reallocates resources throughout the data center to support the current demand.
* Public clouds are viable because they offer many options for computing, storage, and a rich set of other services.
* With many resources always available, public cloud consumers can quickly select, optimize, and use those resources that match the needs of the applications they will run in the public cloud.
* Most public cloud providers offer a wide variety of APIs and services, such as security, and specialized infrastructure to support specific workloads like Graphic Processor Units (GPUs) for data science, application development pipelines, and other technologies to support customer needs.
* All of these cloud services are available in an on-demand manner.
* Public cloud vendors are increasingly offering dedicated, non-multi-tenancy instances within their data center.

# The Private Cloud

* A private cloud is a set of hardware, networking, storage, services, applications, and interfaces owned and operated by an organization for the use of its employees, partners, or customers.
* A private cloud can be created and managed by a third party for the exclusive use of one enterprise.
* The organization retains complete control of the cloud deployment but can leverage the advantages of cloud technologies.
* This is especially viable for very large enterprises. The private cloud is a highly controlled environment not open for public consumption.
* Thus, a private cloud sits behind a firewall. The private cloud is highly automated with a focus on governance, security, and compliance.

* Increasingly, public cloud vendors are packaging their cloud services into appliances that can be installed within a customer’s on-premises data center behind the firewall.
* The appliance typically contains access to all of the cloud services that the cloud vendor offers on the public cloud.
* The consumption models for these appliance based on premises public clouds can vary — the vendor may manage and own the appliance and bill the client in the same way that they bill public cloud use, or the customer may own and maintain the appliance.
* This model of public cloud capabilities behind the firewall is quickly gaining traction.

  
# Cloud Architecture Considerations 

# Type of Constituents

* Cloud consumers:  The individuals and groups within your business unit that use different types of cloud services to get a task accomplished. A cloud consumer could be a developer using computing services from a public cloud.
* Direct customers:  Users who often take advantage of services that your business has created within a cloud environment. End users of your service have no idea that you are using a public or private cloud. As far as the users are concerned, they are interacting directly with your services and value.
* Cloud service provider:  Commercial vendors or companies that create their own capabilities. Commercial vendors sell their services to cloud consumers. In contrast, a company might decide to become an internal cloud service provider to its own employees, partners, and customers — either as an internal service or as a profit center. These providers also create applications or services for these environments.

* In contrast, if your organization is a cloud service provider, you will spend a lot more time architecting the elements.
* You also need to understand how to build applications and business services that are optimized for this environment.
* These service creators need to be concerned with consistency of the services that they are building so that they can support their customers — both short term and for the long run.

# Planning for Deployment

* The hybrid cloud is not a single architectural model; rather, it is a combination of a lot of different services that are located on different platforms.
* Therefore, there is no simple way to define a hybrid architecture. Instead, from an architectural perspective, it is important to look at the relationship among the services that are used together

* Cloud service providers might be a commercial company or a corporation that decides to become their own cloud service operator.
* Cloud providers may provide the underlying physical and virtualized resources needed to run various cloud services.
* They also may create the actual applications and business services that operate in these environments.

* The cloud provider has to support all the important cloud models.

# Latency and Performance

* When planning your hybrid model, you need to consider the overall performance of your platform, which means that you must monitor and measure your entire environment.
* Latency, or slow response or performance, is a constant concern for customers.
* For example, say that a critical issue for your business is the speed at which customers’ orders are confirmed.
* If you do not handle this issue efficiently, customers won’t be happy and may move to another supplier.
* So, you may want to keep transaction management running within a private cloud or data center environment.
* If you were to use a public cloud transaction management service, the latency involved in moving data between networks would cause service delays.
* So, you may want to keep transaction management running within a private cloud or data center environment.
* If you were to use a public cloud transaction management service, the latency involved in moving data between networks would cause service delays. 

# Security: Planning in Context

* When planning your hybrid environment, at the outset, you need to think about the security requirements for customers.
* You need to understand these considerations before you begin your design. So, make sure your cloud providers can match your requirements.

# Governance: Getting the right balance

* Like security, governance requirements will determine how you plan and architect your hybrid cloud environment.
* Many industries have rules of engagement that are considered best practices.
* Like security, governance requirements will determine how you plan and architect your hybrid cloud environment.
* Managing colocation: In the real world, compromise is a requirement for making computing perform well at an affordable price.
* In a perfect world, cost would never be an issue, but in complicated environments, compromise is a reality.
* The trick is to be able to manage across a hybrid environment that creates an architecturally balanced approach.
* So, when planning your hybrid cloud environment, you need to first select applications that fit well into the benefits and limitations of the cloud.
* Applications that do not match well for such a public cloud environment may need to stay on-premises, either on a traditional middleware deployment or in a private cloud environment.
* When companies or cloud creators have carefully architected their applications or services, they will be well positioned to support a hybrid cloud environment.

# Reliability in the Context of Change

* Companies looking at cloud computing typically assume that it is an all-or-nothing model. However, cloud computing is simply part of an overall distributed architectural plan.
* Within an architectural framework, determining business, performance, and customer goals is important, and to do so, you must consider all aspects of computing.

# Supporting a Dynamic Life Cycle

* The life cycle of cloud computing is different in many ways from the life cycle of a traditional computing environment.
* The architecture of the cloud environment is predicated on the ability to abstract the details away from users based on a services-oriented architecture.
* As a result of the cloud, you must think about the term life cycle in a new way.

* Think about an overall services-based model that breaks down traditional disconnected silos of applications, processes, and services.
* Think about creating an environment with fewer dependencies so that when you add new cloud services, you will have the flexibility to advance as the industry advances.
* Think about the performance requirements that will give your customers excellent experiences.
* Think about creating a predictable, safe, and well-governed environment that will support business operations in the long run.
