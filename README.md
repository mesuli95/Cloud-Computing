# Cloud-Computing

<summary> Introduction to cloud computing </summary>

* The impact of cloud computing on businesses across industries cannot be overstated.
* It has revolutionized the way organizations operate, offering essential features like on-demand access to computing power and storage, virtually unlimited scalability, and flexible pricing models.
* As a result, startups have been able to disrupt established industry players, while established businesses have leveraged the cloud to enhance their capabilities and rapidly transform their processes.
* Initially, the adoption of cloud technologies focused primarily on cost reduction and shifting technology expenditures from capital to operational expenses.
* Cloud vendors prioritized lowering costs for standard computing and storage resources.
* While cost reduction remains a significant factor in cloud adoption, companies now recognize the potential of cloud services to drive business transformation.
* As a result, most organizations have embraced a pragmatic hybrid cloud strategy, utilizing a combination of public and private cloud services based on their specific business needs.
* They retain critical applications within their data centers while leveraging innovative SoThe cloud market has evolved to cater to diverse customer requirements.
* Cloud providers now specialize in specific areas to deliver unique value to customers.ftware as a Service (SaaS) applications and cloud infrastructure services.
* The cloud market has evolved to cater to diverse customer requirements. Cloud providers now specialize in specific areas to deliver unique value to customers.
* Some focus on offering machine learning services, while others specialize in governance cloud services.
* Additionally, a range of cloud storage services is available from various vendors.

# Five characteristics defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
# ON-Demand Self-Service

* Consumers can provision resources as needed and automatically. Cloud services consumers can provision services on an as-needed basis, without the need to work with the CSP (Cloud service provider) directly.
* These resources might include additional compute power, additional storage, new websites, or even database services.
* The consumer can expand (or reduce) these services without the need for human assistance from the CSP.

# Broad Network Access

* Services are available across the network from commonly available clients.
* Client devices and traditional server deployments are able to access cloud-based resources across the network.
* The network might include the local on-premises network or the Internet, or both. Cloud resources have the potential to be globally accessible.

# Resource Pooling

* The cloud service provider (CSP) pools resources in a multitenant model and adjusts resource allocation on an on-demand basis, and the specific distribution of hardware resources is abstracted from the consumer.
* CSPs pool network, storage, and compute capabilities and then dynamically and automatically allocate those resources to consumers on an on-demand basis.
* The consumers do not know (or care) where the resources might physically be located.
* The next time those services are used by the consumer, the resource locations might have changed.
* The CSP manages the resources and maximizes their use.

# Rapid Elasticity

* Resources are provisioned and released to adjust for changes in demand and consumption.
* This process may be automatic or manual.
* Server resources in a traditional model are purchased as a capital expenditure, and whether or not those resources are efficiently utilized, their cost and capabilities are fixed.
* In some business models, resource needs change throughout the year.
* For example, retail demand is significantly higher during some parts of the year than others.
* With cloud-based computing, resources are dynamically allocated, making for far more efficient utilization of those resources.
* Servers that might have been underutilized for most of the year no longer need to be purchased and maintained.

# Measured Service

* Metering of resources is monitored, controlled, and billable. CSPs meter the utilization of their resources.
* This metering permits more efficient and dynamic resource allocation.
* It also permits the CSPs to bill consumers accurately for exactly the quantity of resources consumed.
